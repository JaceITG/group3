# Group 3 Quiz Application

lorem ipsum lol

## Todo

-stylize front end (questions, summary) with css
-add question pagination buttons (previous, next question)

## Backend

Using Node API server:

-see group3/crud-example

-testing:

```bash
cd crud-example
npm install
node othertest.js
```

Only shows results of some random person-related tests atm. Can modify client.js and server.js to better represent our quiz application later.

-maybe useful?
    [create-react-app server article](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/)

-fetch('/api/...") calls *(not sure if this is the correct approach, but keeping it on the table)*
